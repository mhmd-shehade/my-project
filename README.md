# React + Vite

Using Vite with React provides a fast and optimized development environment, ensuring rapid build times and live updates. It simplifies project setup and enhances the overall developer experience.

Tailwind CSS can be seamlessly integrated with Vite to enable utility-first styling, making it easier to create responsive and consistent designs efficiently.

## State Management  
I have used Redux Toolkit for state management, which simplifies the process of managing application state with powerful tools and boilerplate reduction.

## Authentication  
In the sign-up and login process, user information is stored in `localStorage` for persistent authentication across sessions.

To run the project, use:  
```bash
npm run dev
